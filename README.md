# Diamler-Hackathon
Its an online service android app for Mercedes - benz company to provide cab services to there customer. Customer can lock the app for security reason and open it with the help of pattern. Customer can also request for car service to the diamler company.

## Technical details:
This app was built with the support of Parse-Backend service (Mbaas). But now facebook has shut down the parse. We can still run by hosting Parse server over AWS. You can host the parse server over aws and replace the key in constant file of this project. This app also include the sms verification system for sign in . I have used cognalys verification service for this.
